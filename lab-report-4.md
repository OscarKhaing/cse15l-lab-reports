## Hi all! On this page, you will find a detailed step-by-step walk-through of the keys I pressed to complete the competition task from Week 7 Lab. 

---

For this guide, I will separate the 6 steps into different sections of this page as they are numbered (steps 4 to 9). Here is the original list for your reference:

1. **Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account**
2. **Setup Fork the repository**
3. **The real deal Start the timer!**
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

The first 3 highlighted steps are skipped, so we actually start from step 4. Just to avoid confusion, **I will keep the original step number**, so the title of the sections will start from step 4. 

Meanwhile, we will start with the terminal already open and ready to receive input. At the beginning, I will be using the _bash_ terminal, though it doesn't really matter once we log into the **ieng6** secure-shell.

# Step 4:

_Keys pressed:_ 
ssh `<space>` cs15lwi23aki `<shift>`2 ieng6.ucsd.edu `<enter>`
[Here, I typed my password] `<enter>`
