## Hi all! On this page, you will find a guide for 4 different command-line options for the `grep` command in _bash_, each with 2 detailed examples for clarity.
---
## First, what is `grep`?
Linux has been a popular choice of operating system due to its inherent stability. When operating in a linux shell, users must manipulate files through a terminal using a variety of commands. 

One of those commands is `grep`, which is used for finding patterns within files.
> `grep` stands for "Global regular expression print"

For this demonstration, let's first set up the environment. I will be using the data set from the CSE15L Skill Demo 1 that I cloned and stored on my local machine, and I will be operating using _Bash_ terminal, as seen below.

Our operations will mainly be done on the `written_2/` directory.
